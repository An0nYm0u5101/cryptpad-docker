# CryptPad docker

This repository has been created as part of an ongoing effort to separate docker from [the CryptPad platform repo](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad).

The officially recommended deployment method is to use the `example.nginx.conf` file provided by the core repo and to manage updates directly on the host system using `git`, `npm` (as provided by [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) and `bower`.

Docker images and their supporting configuration files are provided as a community effort by those using them, with support provided by the core development team on a _best-effort_ basis. Keep in mind that the core team neither uses nor tests Docker images, so your results may vary.
